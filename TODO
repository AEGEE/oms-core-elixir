Thoughs: What about scoping the single circle endpoints with a plug that automatically fetches the local permissions in case the circle is a bound circle? That would eliminate the need for all those duplicate routes... Would mean that I would have to code all the routes that require distinction in the cond way like show_members but would make frontend development a lot easier.
