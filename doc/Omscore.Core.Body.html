<p>Defines a body schema.</p>
<p>A body holds several information fields and is the biggest structural component of the association modelled.
Also it holds members. There is a bit of a confusion possible between members of the members circle and body members.</p>
<p>Being a body member means being in that body, but this does not imply any permissions yet, as bodies are not part of the permission system.
Thus, we created a shadow circle, which accumulates all members of the body to be able to give all members permissions by default.</p>
<p>We decided to not make a body a circle, as circles normally don&#39;t <strong><em>contain</em></strong> other circles, they only <strong><em>inherit</em></strong> them, and we thought having some circles having both might lead to confusion.
When joining a body, people are automatically added to the shadow circle.</p>
<p>Joining a body is possible through either a <a href="Omscore.Members.JoinRequest.html"><code class="inline">Omscore.Members.JoinRequest</code></a> or through a <a href="Omscore.Registration.Campaign.html"><code class="inline">Omscore.Registration.Campaign</code></a>. 
The join request is for internals, who are already members but want to also be part of the body, the campaign is for externals who are not members yet.
Also, <a href="Omscore.Members.html#create_member_in_body/3"><code class="inline">Omscore.Members.create_member_in_body/3</code></a> can create a member and directly give him body membership, which can be used by administrators to add members which do not want to proactively sign up.</p>
<p><code class="inline">Omscore.Core.Circles</code> which are assigned to the body are called <strong><em>bound circles</em></strong> and treated a bit differently than other circles.</p>
<p>Also there are bodies which pay fees, indicated by the <code class="inline">:pays_fees</code> boolean. These take part in the membership fee system defined in <a href="Omscore.Finances.html"><code class="inline">Omscore.Finances</code></a>.</p>
<p>Most fields should be self-explanatory. <code class="inline">:legacy_key</code> means a short code for a body which can be used for referencing. <code class="inline">:type</code> can be used to differentiate between several types of bodies.</p>
